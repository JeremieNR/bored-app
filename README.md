# bored-app
Attempting to write a windows app that would give you things to do when your bored. For example, you'd open the app and you'd have a list of things to do when you're bored. When you click on a task, it starts a timer (15 to 30 minutes) for that task. At the end, it would ask if you'd like to extend that task or pick a new one. 
Examples of Tasks would be things like: "learn japanese for 30 minutes", "do some python coding for 30 minutes", etc.

As a note, this is my first time coding in C# and doing app development on windows, so progress will be slow!
